    <div>
      <p>
        I am 25 years old and i've been working in software development for over
        5 years. I embarked on my Java journey when I landed a job creating
        desktop softwares, and now focused on Web Development as a Mid-Level
        Developer.
        <span>I'm on a journey to become a skilled FullStack Developer.</span>
        Always excited to learn and take on new challenges in the tech world!

        Besides coding, I love music 🎵 (currently learning piano 🎹), video
        games 🎮 and all kinds of sports (⚽ 🏀 ♟️ 🏋🏽 🏓).
